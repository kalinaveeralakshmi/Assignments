1Q.What makes numpy.shape()different from numpy.size()?
ans.some numpy operations take an argument called shape as np.zeros,whereas some others take an
arguments called size,such as np.random .randint.to me those arguments have the same function
and the fact that they have different names is a bit confusing.actually size seems a bit off.
sence it really specifies the shape of the output.The actual relation between the two is 
size=np.proud(shape).

2Q.In numpy describe the idea of broadcasting.
ans.the term broadcasting to treat arrays of different shapes during arithmetic operations
arithmetic operations on arrays are usually done on corresponding elements if two arrays
are usually done on corresponding elements if two arrays are of exactly the same shape,then
these operations are smoothly performed.
operations on arrays of non-similar shapes is still possible in numpy,because of the 
broadcasting capability.

3Q.What makes python better than other libraries for numerical computations?
ans.storing data in lists&traversing lists with plain python for loops leads to show code,
especially when compared with similar code in compiled languages such as fortran,c,or c++
fortunately there is an extension of python commonly called numerical python,or abbreviated
Numpy,which offers efficient array computations.

4Q.How does Numpy deal with files?
ans.Numpy introduces a simple file format for nd array objects.This npy files stores data,
shape,d type an other information required to reconstruct the nd array in a disk file such
that the array is correctly retrived even if the file is on another machine with different 
architecture.

5Q.Mention the importance of Nump.empty()
ans.The empty()function is used to create a new array of given shape and type,without initializing
elements.
syntax:numpy.empty (shape,dtype=float,order='c')
